    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 1: Disconect from the internet</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Immediately disconnect your computer from the internet to prevent the RAT from communicating with the attacker’s server. This step helps to stop any ongoing data theft and prevents the downloading of additional malware.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 2: Enter safe mode</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Reboot your computer in Safe Mode to limit the RAT’s functionality. Safe Mode loads only the essential system files and services, making it easier to isolate and remove the malware. On Windows, you can enter Safe Mode by restarting your computer and pressing the F8 key during startup.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 3: Install and update antivirus security software</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">If you don’t already have reputable anti-malware software installed, do so using a clean device. MalwareBytes offers a free and reputable anti-malware solution capable of detecting these threats on your computer. You’ll also want to ensure your anti-malware software is up-to-date to the latest version to ensure it has the latest malware definitions.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 4: Run a full system scan</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Conduct a full system scan with your anti-malware software to detect the RAT and any other malicious software that may be present on your system. Follow the software’s recommendations to quarantine or delete any detected threats.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 5: Remove unrecognized programs and files</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Manually check for any unrecognized programs or files that might have been missed by the anti-malware scan. RATs may use randomized filenames and paths to evade detection, so be cautious and remove anything that appears suspicious.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 6: Change your passwords</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">It’s safe to assume that all personal information that you accessed on the infected machine has been compromised. From a clean computer, change all your usernames and passwords – especially for sensitive online banking and email accounts. If the service in question has a “logout from all devices” option, be sure to use it.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 7: Notify any relevant parties</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">If your infected machine was used for work or contains sensitive information, inform your admins about the potential compromise. They may need to take additional steps to secure the network and protect other users.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 8: Monitor your financial accounts</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Keep a close eye on credit reports and bank statements for the following months to help catch any unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity that may indicate identity theft.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: white;">Step 9: Practice safe browsing habits</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, and refrain from installing software from unsolicited emails or messages. Regularly update your security software and operating system to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited by RATs.</h3>
