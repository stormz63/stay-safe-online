    <h2>Havex</h2>
    <h3>Havex is a RAT that targets industrial control systems (ICS). It grants attackers full control over industrial machinery. Havex uses several mutations to avoid detection and has a minimal footprint on the victim device. It communicates with the C&C server over HTTP and HTTPS.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Dark Comet</h2>
    <h3>Dark Comet was first identified in 2011 and is still actively used. It grants full administrative control over infected machines, and can disable Task Manager, firewall, and user access control (UAC) on Windows machines. Dark Comet uses encryption to evade detection by antivirus.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Sub7</h2>
    <h3>Sub7 is a RAT that operates in a client-server model. The server is the component deployed on a victim machine, and the client is a GUI used by the attacker to control the remote system. The server attempts to install itself into the Windows directory. Once deployed, Sub7 enables webcam capture, port redirects, chat, and provides an easy-to-use registry editor.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Heseber BOT</h2>
    <h3>The Heseber BOT is based on VNC, a traditional remote access tool. It uses VNC to provide remote control over the targeted machine and transfer data to the C&C server. However, it does not grant administrative access over the machine unless the user has those permissions. Because VNC is a legitimate tool, Haseber cannot be detected by many antivirus tools.</h3>
